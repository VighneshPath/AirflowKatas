# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive Airflow Coding Kata - a hands-on learning experience that guides developers through Apache Airflow concepts from basic to advanced levels. The kata will include practical exercises, relevant documentation links, and progressive challenges that build upon each other to ensure thorough understanding of Airflow fundamentals including DAGs, tasks, sensors, operators, and advanced concepts like XComs, branching, and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer new to Airflow, I want a structured learning path with clear explanations and examples, so that I can understand core Airflow concepts systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the kata THEN the system SHALL provide a clear introduction to Apache Airflow and its purpose
2. WHEN a user begins the kata THEN the system SHALL present concepts in logical progression from basic to advanced
3. WHEN a user completes each section THEN the system SHALL provide links to official Airflow documentation for deeper learning
4. IF a user is unfamiliar with workflow orchestration THEN the system SHALL explain the fundamental concepts before diving into Airflow specifics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want hands-on exercises for DAGs and tasks, so that I can practice creating and understanding Airflow workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches the DAG section THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples of DAG creation with explanations
2. WHEN a user practices DAG creation THEN the system SHALL include exercises for different DAG configurations and scheduling
3. WHEN a user learns about tasks THEN the system SHALL demonstrate various task types including BashOperator, PythonOperator, and custom operators
4. WHEN a user completes DAG exercises THEN the system SHALL show how to define task dependencies using different methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning Airflow, I want to understand sensors and operators, so that I can build robust data pipelines that respond to external events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user studies sensors THEN the system SHALL provide examples of FileSensor, S3KeySensor, and custom sensors
2. WHEN a user learns about operators THEN the system SHALL demonstrate built-in operators and how to create custom ones
3. WHEN a user practices with sensors THEN the system SHALL include exercises for different sensor configurations and timeout handling
4. WHEN a user works with operators THEN the system SHALL show parameter passing and result handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an intermediate Airflow user, I want to learn advanced concepts like XComs, branching, and error handling, so that I can build complex and resilient workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches advanced topics THEN the system SHALL explain XComs with practical examples of data passing between tasks
2. WHEN a user learns about branching THEN the system SHALL demonstrate BranchPythonOperator and conditional task execution
3. WHEN a user studies error handling THEN the system SHALL show retry mechanisms, failure callbacks, and SLA configurations
4. WHEN a user practices advanced concepts THEN the system SHALL provide exercises combining multiple advanced features

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner, I want practical exercises with real-world scenarios, so that I can apply Airflow concepts to actual use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes basic concepts THEN the system SHALL provide realistic data pipeline scenarios
2. WHEN a user works on practical exercises THEN the system SHALL include examples like ETL processes, data validation, and API integrations
3. WHEN a user encounters challenges THEN the system SHALL provide hints and solution explanations
4. WHEN a user finishes exercises THEN the system SHALL suggest variations and extensions to explore further

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive reference materials and links, so that I can continue learning beyond the kata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any section THEN the system SHALL provide relevant links to official Airflow documentation
2. WHEN a user completes the kata THEN the system SHALL include a curated list of additional resources and best practices
3. WHEN a user needs troubleshooting help THEN the system SHALL provide common issues and solutions
4. WHEN a user wants to explore further THEN the system SHALL suggest advanced topics and community resources

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the kata to be easy to set up and follow, so that I can focus on learning rather than configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the kata THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions for local Airflow development
2. WHEN a user follows setup steps THEN the system SHALL include Docker-based setup for consistency across environments
3. WHEN a user encounters setup issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN a user progresses through exercises THEN the system SHALL ensure each step builds upon previous work without requiring complex reconfiguration
