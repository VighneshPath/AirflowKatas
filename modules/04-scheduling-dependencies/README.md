# Module 4: Scheduling & Dependencies

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create DAGs with complex scheduling patterns using cron expressions
- Understand and implement catchup behavior and backfill scenarios
- Design fan-out and fan-in dependency patterns
- Implement conditional dependencies between tasks
- Apply dependency best practices for robust workflows

## Prerequisites
