# Error Handling & Monitoring Concepts

## Overview

Error handling and monitoring are critical aspects of production Airflow workflows. This module covers strategies for making your DAGs resilient to failures and observable in production environments.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Retry Mechanisms

Airflow provides several ways to handle task failures:

- **Automatic Retries**: Configure tasks to retry automatically on failure
- **Retry Delay**: Set delays between retry attempts
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increase delay between retries exponentially
- **Max Retry Attempts**: Limit the number of retry attempts

### 2. Failure Callbacks

When tasks fail, you can trigger custom actions:

- **on_failure_callback**: Execute when a task fails after all retries
- **on_success_callback**: Execute when a task succeeds
- **on_retry_callback**: Execute on each retry attempt
- **sla_miss_callback**: Execute when SLA is missed

### 3. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

SLAs define expected completion times for tasks:

- **Task SLA**: Maximum time a task should take
- **DAG SLA**: Maximum time for entire DAG completion
- **SLA Monitoring**: Track and alert on SLA violations

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting

Production workflows need comprehensive monitoring:

- **Task State Monitoring**: Track task success/failure rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor execution times and resource usage
- **Custom Alerts**: Send notifications via email, Slack, or other channels
- **Health Checks**: Automated validation of workflow health

## Best Practices

### Retry Strategy Design

1. **Identify Transient vs Permanent Failures**

   - Transient: Network timeouts, temporary resource unavailability
   - Permanent: Code bugs, missing files, authentication failures

2. **Configure Appropriate Retry Counts**

   - Network operations: 3-5 retries
   - File operations: 2-3 retries
   - Database operations: 2-4 retries

3. **Use Exponential Backoff**
   - Prevents overwhelming external systems
   - Allows time for transient issues to resolve

### Callback Implementation

1. **Keep Callbacks Lightweight**

   - Avoid heavy processing in callback functions
   - Use callbacks for notifications and cleanup only

2. **Handle Callback Failures**

   - Callbacks should not raise exceptions
   - Log errors instead of failing

3. **Provide Context Information**
   - Include task details, error messages, and execution context
   - Make alerts actionable with relevant information

### SLA Configuration

1. **Set Realistic SLAs**

   - Base on historical execution times
   - Account for system load variations
   - Include buffer time for unexpected delays

2. **Monitor SLA Trends**
   - Track SLA miss patterns
   - Identify performance degradation early
   - Adjust SLAs based on system changes

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Multi-Level Monitoring**

   - Task-level: Individual task performance
   - DAG-level: Overall workflow health
   - System-level: Airflow infrastructure health

2. **Proactive Alerting**

   - Alert on trends, not just failures
   - Use different alert channels for different severity levels
   - Implement alert escalation for critical issues

3. **Observability**
   - Log structured data for analysis
   - Use metrics for trend analysis
   - Implement distributed tracing for complex workflows

## Common Error Patterns

### Network-Related Errors

```python
# Retry configuration for network operations
default_args = {
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    'retry_exponential_backoff': True,
    'max_retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=30)
}
```

### Resource Exhaustion

```python
# Handle resource constraints
def check_resources(**context):
    # Check available memory, disk space, etc.
    if not sufficient_resources():
        raise AirflowSkipException("Insufficient resources, skipping task")
```

### Data Quality Issues

```python
# Validate data before processing
def validate_data(**context):
    data = get_data()
    if not is_valid(data):
        send_alert("Data quality issue detected")
        raise AirflowFailException("Data validation failed")
```

## Monitoring Tools Integration

### External Monitoring Systems

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **DataDog**: Application performance monitoring
- **New Relic**: Full-stack observability

### Notification Channels

- **Email**: Built-in SMTP support
- **Slack**: Webhook integration
- **PagerDuty**: Incident management
- **Custom Webhooks**: Integration with any HTTP endpoint

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Graceful Degradation

Design workflows that can continue operating with reduced functionality when components fail.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing components.

### Compensation Actions

Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations that have side effects.

### Dead Letter Queues

Route failed tasks to separate queues for manual investigation and reprocessing.
