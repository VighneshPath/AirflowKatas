# Final Assessment: Complete Data Pipeline

## Overview

This final assessment combines all concepts learned throughout the Airflow Coding Kata. You will build a complete data pipeline that demonstrates mastery of DAGs, tasks, operators, sensors, XComs, branching, error handling, and monitoring.

## Scenario

You are building a data pipeline for an e-commerce company that processes daily sales data, validates it, transforms it, and generates reports. The pipeline should handle various data quality scenarios and provide comprehensive monitoring.

## Requirements

### 1. DAG Configuration (Module 1-2 Concepts)

- Create a DAG named `ecommerce_data_pipeline`
- Schedule to run daily at 2 AM UTC
- Set appropriate start_date, catchup, and retry settings
- Include comprehensive documentation

### 2. Data Extraction Tasks (Module 3 Concepts)

- **extract_sales_data**: Use BashOperator to download sales data
- **extract_customer_data**: Use PythonOperator to fetch customer information
- **check_data_availability**: Use FileSensor to wait for required files

### 3. Data Validation and Quality Checks (Module 4-5 Concepts)

- **validate_data_format**: Check file formats and schemas
- **data_quality_checks**: Validate data completeness and accuracy
- **handle_data_issues**: Branch based on data quality results

### 4. Data Transformation (Module 6-7 Concepts)

- **clean_sales_data**: Clean and standardize sales data
- **enrich_customer_data**: Add customer segmentation
- **calculate_metrics**: Compute daily KPIs
- Use XComs to pass data between transformation tasks

### 5. Conditional Processing (Module 7 Concepts)

- **check_business_rules**: Validate business logic
- **route_processing**: Branch to different processing paths based on data volume
- **weekend_special_processing**: Additional processing for weekend data

### 6. Error Handling and Monitoring (Module 8 Concepts)

- Implement retry strategies for all tasks
- Add failure callbacks for critical tasks
- Set up SLA monitoring
- Create custom alerting for data quality issues

### 7. Advanced Patterns (Module 9 Concepts)

- Use TaskGroups to organize related tasks
- Implement dynamic task generation for multiple data sources
- Add performance optimization techniques

### 8. Real-world Integration (Module 10 Concepts)

- **api_integration**: Call external APIs for data enrichment
- **database_operations**: Write results to database
- **generate_reports**: Create business reports
- **send_notifications**: Notify stakeholders of completion

## Success Criteria

Your solution should demonstrate:

1. **Proper DAG Structure**: Well-organized, documented, and configured
2. **Task Dependencies**: Logical flow with appropriate dependencies
3. **Error Resilience**: Proper error handling and recovery
4. **Data Flow**: Effective use of XComs and data passing
5. **Conditional Logic**: Smart branching based on data conditions
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting
7. **Best Practices**: Following Airflow and Python best practices
8. **Real-world Readiness**: Production-ready code quality

## Bonus Challenges

- Implement custom operators for specific business logic
- Add data lineage tracking
- Create a custom XCom backend for large data
- Implement advanced scheduling with external triggers
- Add comprehensive unit tests

## Submission

Create your solution as `final_assessment_solution.py` in the assessments directory.
Include detailed comments explaining your design decisions and how each requirement is addressed.

## Time Estimate

This assessment should take 2-3 hours to complete thoroughly.
Focus on demonstrating understanding of concepts rather than complex business logic.

## Evaluation Rubric

### Excellent (90-100%)

- All requirements implemented correctly

- Implements bonus challenges

### Good (80-89%)

- Most requirements implemented correctly
- Shows solid understanding of core concepts
- Good code quality with basic error handling
- Adequate documentation
- May implement some bonus features

### Satisfactory (70-79%)

- Core requirements implemented
- Basic understanding of Airflow concepts demonstrated
- Code works but may lack polish
- Minimal documentation
- Focuses on basic functionality

### Needs Improvement (60-69%)

- Some requirements missing or incorrect
- Limited understanding of concepts
- Code has issues or doesn't run properly
- Poor or missing documentation
- Incomplete implementation

### Unsatisfactory (Below 60%)

- Major requirements missing
- Fundamental misunderstanding of concepts
- Code doesn't work or has serious issues
- No meaningful documentation
- Incomplete or non-functional solution

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. Review the relevant module concepts and examples
2. Check the Airflow documentation links provided in each module
3. Look at similar patterns in the solution files
4. Focus on demonstrating understanding rather than perfect implementation
5. Document any assumptions or limitations in your comments

## Next Steps

After completing this assessment:

1. Review your solution against the rubric
2. Consider implementing bonus challenges
3. Explore advanced Airflow features not covered in the kata
4. Apply these concepts to real-world projects
5. Continue learning with the resources provided in the kata

Good luck! This assessment is your opportunity to showcase everything you've learned about Apache Airflow.
